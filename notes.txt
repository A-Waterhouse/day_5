core web technologies

- javascript (code that can be run on websites)
- html (format which websites are created)
- css (cascading style sheets, takes structure of the html and adds levels of styles to it)

boiler plate (stuff that should be in every file)

html is written using tags, something inside braces <>

html will be organised within tags which will have context and meaning
the tags will be used to make it semantic, enables different devices to be used to read site, informs user what the contex is



<h1> heading number 1, can have other numbers 1-6
<p> paragraph
<section> used to portion parts of the site off
<ul> unordered list
<li> list item
<ol> list items with numbers

tags are closed with </>
not all need closing

eg meta tag     <meta charset="UTF-8"> 

image tag have attributes <img src="" alt=""> source and alt

<div> and <span> used to divide up site, only visually non semantic
