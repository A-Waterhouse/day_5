HTML
What is html
what is semantic html, semantics in html gives us the meaning for the tag we are using
accessibility, why it matters

need to be written in a way that is useful for people reading it, so devs/other people/users can read and us it easily
not everyone will be interacting with websites in the same way

must include:
people with;-
-impaired vision,
-motor difficulties
-impairments or learning difficulties
-deaf people
-etc...

core web technologies

- javascript (code that can be run on websites)
- html (format which websites are created)
- css (cascading style sheets, takes structure of the html and adds levels of styles to it)

boiler plate (stuff that should be in every file)

html is written using tags, something inside braces <>

html will be organised within tags which will have context and meaning
the tags will be used to make it semantic, enables different devices to be used to read site, informs user what the contex is



<h1> heading number 1, can have other numbers 1-6
<p> paragraph
<section> used to portion parts of the site off
<ul> unordered list
<li> list item
<ol> list items with numbers

tags are closed with </>
not all need closing

eg meta tag     <meta charset="UTF-8"> 

image tag have attributes <img src="" alt=""> source and alt

<div> and <span> used to divide up site, only visually non semantic

what is css
why we use css
how to apply css to a HTML document to update it visually

css styles parts of the HTML document

cascading the style throughout the websites

there is a default setting included in html which is applied automatically 

css is language that expresses the presentation of structured documents

css must be linked to the html document in the <head> part
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/style.css">

how to apply styling to the page
select the element you want to apply style to
body {
    font-family: 
    color:
    background-color:

}

because of cascading the elements will be styled in the parent child relationship, info will be passed along to any children

*{
    this will apply styles to the whole document
    color:
    font-family:
}

not all attributes cascade eg. border in body wont cascade down to the children

defining group of elements
using a class to target a group for styling
<li class="shopping_list_item">item</li>
class/group is now called shopping_list_item
 a . (period) is used in the css file to target that part of the html
 
 .shopping_list_item{
    background-color:
 }

 to target a specific single element we can use an inside

<li id="list_item">item</li>
then we can us the # symbol in the css to target that element
#list_item {
    background-color:
}

to create space between elements we consider
border
margin
padding

margin is the space around
border is space between items
padding is size internally

when we access things that are more specific with id or class the priority will change to the items in that class

top priority, 
id
class
element selectors
passed down, cascaded from other styles to the children elements

css is read and applied top to bottom

try to be generic than add layers of specificity as you go along

flex and grid
flex use to order or separate items

grid is used to make thing more structured
